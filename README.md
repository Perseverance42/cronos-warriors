Cronos Warriors is meant to be a ruthless PvP NFT game in which progression is always symetrical, meaning that if one player gains progress a different player has or had to lose that progress.
Players are able to mint their own characters for a fixed fee. This fee is a 1:1 representation of that characters experience.
Player characters can engage in mutual combat and fight for their experience.
Player characters can be burned by the owner at any time to release the backed experience as CRO.
Each battle does take 0.1% of exchanged experienance as fee. The collected reserve can be distributed in events in which players can participate in PvE combat.
